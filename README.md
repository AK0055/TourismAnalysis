# TourismAnalysis
This project aims at analysing various tourism trends and answers to questions based on places  customers (with respect to adults/children) have most frequency of booking and travel, also the  most impactful channel for most number of bookings. The Expedia dataset, that we are using in this  project, contains their customerâ€™s travel information like what they searched for, whether or not the  search result was a travel package, the check in and check out date. It aims at understanding user  and customer behavior with the data given in terms of tourism packages provided by Expedia.
